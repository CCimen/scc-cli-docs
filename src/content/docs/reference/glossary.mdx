## Core Concepts

### Session
A Claude Code work session running inside a Docker container. Sessions persist across restarts and can be resumed with `scc start --resume`.

### Sandbox
The Docker container that isolates Claude Code from the host system. Sandboxes provide security through containerization while allowing workspace access.

### Profile (Team Profile)
A configuration set for a specific team. Profiles define plugins, MCP servers, session settings, and delegation rules.

### Worktree
A git worktree created for parallel development. Each worktree has its own working directory and can run independent Claude sessions.

### Workspace
The directory mounted into the sandbox. Typically a git repository root where Claude Code operates.

## Configuration

### Organization Config (org-config.json)
The top-level configuration file hosted by an organization. Defines security policies, marketplaces, defaults, and team profiles.

### Team Config
Configuration specific to a team. Can be inline (in org config) or federated (external repository).

### Project Config (.scc.yaml)
Optional per-repository configuration. Allows projects to add plugins and MCP servers within team-allowed boundaries.

### Federation (Federated Teams)
Teams that store their configuration in external repositories, enabling independent management while respecting organization security policies.

### Config Source
The location of a federated team's configuration (GitHub, GitLab, HTTPS URL).

## Security & Governance

### Security Block
Glob patterns that absolutely prevent usage of certain plugins, MCP servers, or Docker images. Cannot be overridden.

### Delegation
The system controlling which teams can add resources and whether projects can extend team configurations.

### Exception
A time-bounded override for governance controls. Local overrides bypass delegation; policy exceptions bypass security blocks.

### Trust Grant
Permissions given to federated teams, controlling marketplace inheritance and additional marketplace definitions.

### Safety Net
The `scc-safety-net` plugin that blocks destructive git commands like `push --force` and `reset --hard`.

## Plugins & Tools

### Plugin
An extension that adds capabilities to Claude Code. Installed from marketplaces.

### Marketplace
A repository containing plugins. Can be official, organization-internal, or team-specific.

### MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)
External services that provide context or tools to Claude. Types: HTTP, SSE (Server-Sent Events), or stdio (local process).

### Stdio MCP
An MCP server running as a local process. Disabled by default due to elevated privileges.

## Operations

### Dry Run
Preview mode that shows what would happen without actually executing. Used with `scc start --dry-run`.

### Config Explain
Command that shows effective configuration with source tracking. Run with `scc config explain`.

### Audit
Inspection of installed plugins and their status. Run with `scc audit plugins`.

### Prune
Cleanup of stopped containers or stale worktree entries.

## Technical Terms

### TTL (Time To Live)
Duration before an exception expires. Specified as `8h`, `30m`, `1d`, etc.

### Glob Pattern
Wildcard pattern using `*` for matching. For example, `*experimental*` matches any string containing "experimental".

### Cache TTL
How long SCC caches remote configurations before re-fetching. Default: 24 hours.

### Exit Code
Numeric code returned by commands indicating success or failure type. See [CLI Overview](/reference/cli/overview/).
