import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Personal profiles let you save and re-apply your own Claude Code settings (plugins, MCP servers) per project. They're stored outside the repo and auto-applied on `scc start`.

<Aside type="note">
  When SCC applies a profile, it enforces org security blocks and stdio MCP gating. Manual edits
  to local workspace files are detected as drift—SCC will warn and require confirmation before overwriting.
</Aside>

## Quick Access

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="TUI (Visual)" icon="laptop">
    Press `p` in dashboard or go to **Settings → Profiles**
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI (Terminal)" icon="terminal">
    Use `scc profile` commands below
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

---

## TUI Integration

The Settings TUI provides visual profile management without memorizing CLI commands.

### Accessing Profiles in TUI

**Method 1: Quick Menu**
- Press `p` from the dashboard to open the profile quick menu
- Options: Save, Apply, Show diff, Open in Settings

**Method 2: Settings Screen**
- Press `s` to open Settings & Maintenance
- Navigate to the **Profiles** tab
- Actions: Save profile, Apply profile, Show diff, Sync profiles

### Sync Profiles Overlay

The **Sync profiles** action opens an overlay picker:

```
› 📁 ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles  Change path
  Export                      Save profiles to folder
  Import                      Load profiles from folder
  Full sync                   Load then save  (advanced)
```

<Aside type="note">
TUI sync writes files locally only—no git commit or push. Use the CLI with `--commit --push` flags for git operations.
</Aside>

**Import Preview:** Before importing, you'll see a preview of what will change:
- `+` (green) — New profiles to add
- `~` (yellow) — Existing profiles to update
- `·` (dim) — Unchanged profiles

---

## CLI Commands

### scc profile list

List all saved personal profiles.

```bash
scc profile list
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--workspace PATH` | Show the profile for a specific workspace |

---

### scc profile save

Save the current workspace settings as a personal profile.

```bash
scc profile save [--workspace PATH]
```

**Sandbox Plugin Detection:** If SCC detects plugins that only exist in sandbox settings (installed inside the container), it offers to import them into `.claude/settings.local.json` before saving.

<Aside type="tip">
Run `scc profile status` first to see if there are sandbox-only plugins to import.
</Aside>

---

### scc profile apply

Apply your personal profile to the current workspace.

```bash
scc profile apply [--workspace PATH] [--preview] [--dry-run] [--force]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--preview` | Show diff without writing |
| `--dry-run` | Alias for `--preview` |
| `--force` | Apply even if drift is detected |

**Skipped Items:** If your personal profile contains plugins or MCP servers that are blocked by org security policy, they will be skipped with a warning:

```
Skipped plugin 'experimental-tool': blocked by org policy (*experimental*)
Skipped MCP server 'evil-mcp': blocked by org policy (evil-*)
```

This ensures org security blocks are enforced even on personal preferences.

---

### scc profile diff

Show diff between your personal profile and current workspace settings.

```bash
scc profile diff [--workspace PATH]
```

**Output indicators:**
- `+` — In profile only (will be added)
- `−` — In workspace only (will be removed)
- `~` — Modified (values differ)

---

### scc profile status

Show whether a profile exists, when it was last applied, and if drift is detected.

```bash
scc profile status [--workspace PATH]
```

**Status indicators:**
- `saved · ✓ synced` — Profile exists and matches workspace
- `saved · ◇ drifted` — Profile exists but workspace has changed
- `none` — No profile saved for this workspace

When sandbox-only plugin changes are found, status can offer to import and save them.

---

## Syncing Profiles

Share profiles across machines using any folder (typically a git repo like `~/dotfiles`).

### scc profile export

Export profiles to a local folder.

```bash
scc profile export --repo PATH [--workspace PATH] [--commit] [--push] [--force]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--repo PATH` | Destination folder for exported profiles |
| `--workspace PATH` | Export only this workspace's profile |
| `--commit` | Create a git commit after export |
| `--push` | Push to remote after commit |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing files |

---

### scc profile import

Import profiles from a local folder.

```bash
scc profile import --repo PATH [--force] [--preview] [--dry-run]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--repo PATH` | Source folder containing profiles |
| `--preview` | Show what would be imported without writing |
| `--dry-run` | Alias for `--preview` |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing local profiles |

---

### scc profile sync

Bidirectional sync: import from repo, then export to repo.

```bash
scc profile sync --repo PATH [--pull] [--commit] [--push] [--force]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--repo PATH` | Folder to sync with |
| `--pull` | Git pull before importing |
| `--commit` | Git commit after exporting |
| `--push` | Git push after commit |
| `--force` | Force overwrite on conflicts |

---

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Basic Workflow">
```bash
# Save your current settings
scc profile save

# Check if profile matches workspace
scc profile status

# Apply profile (after team config changes, etc.)
scc profile apply --preview   # See what will change
scc profile apply             # Actually apply
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cross-Machine Sync">
```bash
# On Machine A: Export to dotfiles repo
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --commit --push

# On Machine B: Import from dotfiles repo
cd ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles && git pull
scc profile import --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles

# Or use sync for bidirectional
scc profile sync --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --pull --commit --push
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="TUI Workflow">
```bash
# Launch SCC dashboard
scc

# Press 'p' for quick profile menu
# Or press 's' → Profiles tab → Sync profiles

# In Sync overlay:
# 1. Set your repo path (saved for next time)
# 2. Choose Export, Import, or Full sync
# 3. Import shows preview before applying
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## File Locations

Profiles are stored in your user config directory:

```
~/.config/scc/personal/projects/<hash>.json
```

Each profile contains:
- `repo_id` — Identifier for the workspace (git remote or path)
- `settings` — Claude Code settings (plugins, etc.)
- `mcp` — MCP server configurations
- `saved_at` — Timestamp of last save

Export destination (configurable):
```
~/dotfiles/scc-profiles/   # Default/example
├── <hash>.json
├── <hash>.json
└── ...
```
