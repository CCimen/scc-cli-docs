Schema reference for project-level configuration (`.scc.yaml`).

## Location

Place `.scc.yaml` in your repository root:

```
my-project/
├── .scc.yaml
├── src/
└── ...
```

## Requirements

For `.scc.yaml` to take effect:
1. Org enables project delegation (`delegation.projects.inherit_team_delegation: true`)
2. Team has `delegation.allow_project_overrides: true`
3. Resources must not match security blocks
4. Plugins must match `defaults.allowed_plugins` (if specified)

## Top-Level Structure

```yaml
additional_plugins: []
additional_mcp_servers: []
session: {}
```

## additional_plugins

Plugins to add for this project.

```yaml
additional_plugins:
  - project-linter@internal
  - react-tools@claude-plugins-official
```

Requirements:
- Team must allow project overrides
- Plugin must match `defaults.allowed_plugins` patterns
- Plugin must not match org's `blocked_plugins`

<Aside type="note">
  Projects can only add plugins, not remove team-level plugins.
</Aside>

## additional_mcp_servers

MCP servers for this project.

```yaml
additional_mcp_servers:
  - name: project-api
    type: http
    url: https://api.myproject.com/mcp
```

### HTTP/SSE Server

```yaml
additional_mcp_servers:
  - name: context7
    type: sse
    url: https://context7.com/api
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${CONTEXT7_TOKEN}"
```

### Stdio Server

```yaml
additional_mcp_servers:
  - name: local-tool
    type: stdio
    command: /usr/local/bin/tool
    args:
      - --config
      - ./tool.conf
```

Requires:
- Org to set `security.allow_stdio_mcp: true`
- Command path to match `security.allowed_stdio_prefixes`
- MCP server must match `defaults.allowed_mcp_servers` (if specified)

## session

Session settings for this project.

```yaml
session:
  timeout_hours: 8
  auto_resume: false
```

Project session settings override team settings.

<Aside type="note">
  `session.auto_resume` is advisory only in v1. It is accepted but not enforced at runtime.
</Aside>

## Notes

- Unknown keys are ignored; `scc config validate` will warn.
- `mcp_servers` is accepted as a legacy alias for `additional_mcp_servers`.
- `.scc.yaml` does not set team selection or entry directories.

## Complete Example

```yaml
additional_plugins:
  - project-linter@internal
  - react-devtools@claude-plugins-official
  - team-formatter@internal

additional_mcp_servers:
  - name: project-api
    type: http
    url: https://api.myproject.com/mcp
  - name: local-analyzer
    type: stdio
    command: /opt/tools/analyzer
    args:
      - --project
      - .

session:
  timeout_hours: 8
  auto_resume: true
```

<Aside type="note">
  `session.auto_resume` is advisory only in v1. It is accepted but not enforced at runtime.
</Aside>

## Validation

Validate your project config:

```bash
# In the project directory
scc config validate

# Inspect denied additions
scc config explain --field denied
```

## Common Issues

### "Team disallows project overrides"

Run:

```bash
scc config explain --field denied
```

Look for a "Denied Additions" entry with reason `team '<team>' disabled project overrides`.

### "Plugin doesn't match allowed patterns"

Run:

```bash
scc config explain --field denied
```

Look for a "Denied Additions" entry with reason `Plugin not allowed by defaults.allowed_plugins`.

### "Blocked by security policy"

Run:

```bash
scc config explain --field blocked
```

Look for a "Blocked Items" entry showing the `security.blocked_plugins` pattern.
