## The Three Layers

```
Organization Config
    ↓ security blocks + defaults
Team Profile
    ↓ additional plugins/servers
Project (.scc.yaml)
    ↓ project-specific additions
```

## Merge Behavior

| Setting Type | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| Plugins | Accumulate (additive) |
| MCP Servers | Accumulate, later overrides same name |
| Security Blocks | Cannot be overridden |
| Session Settings | Last wins |

## Example

Org defaults: `["safety-net"]`
Team adds: `["java-tools"]`
Project adds: `["linter"]`

Effective: `["safety-net", "java-tools", "linter"]`

## Tracking Sources

```bash
scc config explain
```

Shows where each setting comes from.
