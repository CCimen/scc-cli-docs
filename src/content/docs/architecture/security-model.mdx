## Isolation Layers

1. **Docker Container**: Claude Code runs isolated from host
2. **Network Policy**: Control container network posture (partial enforcement in v1)
3. **Plugin Governance**: Only approved plugins execute
4. **Git Protection**: Safety net blocks destructive commands

## Enforcement States

SCC uses these enforcement states in docs and CLI output:

- **Enforced**: SCC changes runtime behavior deterministically.
- **Partially enforced**: SCC enforces part of the intent and warns about the rest.
- **Advisory**: SCC validates and reports but does not enforce at runtime.
- **Out of scope**: SCC does not attempt to govern this surface.

## Permissions Mode

SCC launches Claude Code with permission prompts skipped by default inside the sandbox.
This reduces friction but does not provide data loss prevention.
You can re-enable prompts inside Claude if you want stricter confirmation.

## Trust Boundaries

| Source | Trust Level | Can Override |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Organization | Absolute | Nothing |
| Team | Delegated | Within org bounds |
| Project | Restricted | Within team bounds |
| User | Advisory | Profile apply enforces org blocks; manual overrides are advisory |

## Security Blocks

Patterns in `security.blocked_*` are absolute:
- Cannot be overridden by teams
- Cannot be overridden by projects
- Cannot be overridden by exceptions

## Exceptions

Time-bounded overrides for governance controls. See [Exceptions](/guides/organization/exceptions/).
