## Isolation Layers

1. **Docker Container**: Claude Code runs isolated from host
2. **Network Policy**: Control container network access
3. **Plugin Governance**: Only approved plugins execute
4. **Git Protection**: Safety net blocks destructive commands

## Trust Boundaries

| Source | Trust Level | Can Override |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Organization | Absolute | Nothing |
| Team | Delegated | Within org bounds |
| Project | Restricted | Within team bounds |
| User | None | Exceptions only |

## Security Blocks

Patterns in `security.blocked_*` are absolute:
- Cannot be overridden by teams
- Cannot be overridden by projects
- Cannot be overridden by exceptions

## Exceptions

Time-bounded overrides for governance controls. See [Exceptions](/guides/organization/exceptions/).
