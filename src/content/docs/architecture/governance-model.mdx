## Delegation Hierarchy

<DrawioDiagram src="/diagrams/governance-delegation2.svg" alt="Governance & Delegation Model" />

## Delegation Controls

Organization → Teams:
```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "teams": {
      "allow_additional_plugins": ["*"],
      "allow_additional_mcp_servers": ["platform"]
    }
  }
}
```

Teams → Projects:
```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "allow_project_overrides": true,
    "allow_additional_plugins": ["project-*"]
  }
}
```

## Federated Teams

Teams can manage their own configs externally:
- Org sets trust grants
- Team manages within trust bounds
- Security blocks still apply

See [Federation](/guides/organization/federation/).
