  { question: "What are AI coding guardrails?", answer: "AI coding guardrails are controls that limit what AI coding assistants can do. Examples include blocking destructive git commands, restricting plugin installation, controlling network access, and enforcing team-wide configuration standards." },
  { question: "How does SCC implement guardrails for Claude Code?", answer: "SCC implements guardrails through: Docker isolation (filesystem boundaries), Safety Net plugin (blocks git push --force, reset --hard, etc.), plugin governance (org-approved plugins only), and team profiles (consistent configuration)." },
  { question: "Can developers bypass SCC guardrails?", answer: "Security blocks at the organization level cannot be bypassed. Team and project-level configurations respect org boundaries. Exceptions require explicit approval with time limits and audit trails." }

AI coding assistants are powerful tools, but power needs boundaries. Guardrails help teams adopt AI safely by limiting potential damage from mistakes or unexpected behavior.

## What Are Guardrails?

Guardrails are controls that constrain what AI coding assistants can do:

| Guardrail Type | What It Controls |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Git safety** | Prevents destructive version control operations |
| **Filesystem isolation** | Limits which files AI can access |
| **Plugin governance** | Controls which extensions are allowed |
| **Network policies** | Restricts outbound connections |
| **Configuration standards** | Ensures consistent behavior across team |

## SCC's Guardrail Layers

### Layer 1: Docker Isolation

Every Claude Code session runs in a container:

- AI sees only mounted directories
- Host filesystem is inaccessible
- Clean separation between sessions

```bash
scc start ~/project
# Claude Code can only access ~/project
# Cannot reach ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, other directories
```

### Layer 2: Safety Net Plugin

The `scc-safety-net` plugin blocks dangerous git commands:

| Blocked | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `git push --force` | Overwrites remote history |
| `git reset --hard` | Discards uncommitted changes |
| `git branch -D` | Force-deletes branches |
| `git clean -fd` | Deletes untracked files |

Installation is automatic with most org configurations:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "enabled_plugins": ["scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"]
  }
}
```

### Layer 3: Plugin Governance

Organizations control which plugins are allowed:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "blocked_plugins": [
      "*experimental*",
      "*untrusted*"
    ]
  },
  "defaults": {
    "enabled_plugins": [
      "scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official",
      "approved-tool@internal"
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Blocked plugins**: Cannot be used by anyone
- **Enabled plugins**: Available to all teams
- **Team additions**: Teams can add plugins within allowed boundaries

### Layer 4: Network Policies

Control what external connections Claude Code can make:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "network_policy": "isolated"
  }
}
```

<Aside type="note">
  Network policy enforcement is partial in v1. SCC validates policy and warns, but full enforcement depends on Docker network configuration.
</Aside>

### Layer 5: Team Profiles

Ensure consistent configuration across developers:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "backend": {
      "additional_plugins": ["java-analyzer@internal"],
      "session": { "timeout_hours": 8 }
    },
    "frontend": {
      "additional_plugins": ["eslint-runner@internal"],
      "session": { "timeout_hours": 4 }
    }
  }
}
```

Developers run `scc setup` once to inherit all team settings.

## Trust Hierarchy

SCC enforces a trust hierarchy where higher levels override lower ones:

| Level | Trust | Can Override |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Organization | Absolute | Nothing |
| Team | Delegated | Within org bounds |
| Project | Restricted | Within team bounds |
| User | Advisory | Within project bounds |

**Security blocks are absolute**—no team, project, or user can bypass them.

## Implementing Guardrails

### Step 1: Define Organization Policies

Create an org config with security blocks:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "scc.cli/v1",
  "kind": "OrganizationConfig",
  "metadata": { "name": "my-org" },
  "security": {
    "blocked_plugins": ["*experimental*"],
    "blocked_mcp_servers": ["*untrusted*"]
  },
  "defaults": {
    "enabled_plugins": ["scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Team Profiles

Add team-specific settings:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "default": {
      "description": "Standard development profile"
    },
    "security-team": {
      "description": "Stricter controls for security work",
      "additional_plugins": [],
      "network_policy": "isolated"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Distribute Configuration

Host the config where teams can access it:

```bash
# Developers configure once
scc setup --org https://company.com/org-config.json
```

### Step 4: Verify Enforcement

```bash
# Check what's blocked
scc config explain

# Dry run to see effective configuration
scc start --dry-run ~/project
```

## Exceptions

Sometimes guardrails need temporary overrides. SCC supports time-bounded exceptions:

```bash
scc exception add local-override \
  --allow-plugin "experimental-tool@vendor" \
  --ttl 8h \
  --reason "Testing integration"
```

Exceptions:
- Have time limits (TTL)
- Require explicit reasons
- Are visible in `scc config explain`
- Cannot override absolute security blocks

## Auditing

Track guardrail status and exceptions:

```bash
# List active exceptions
scc exception list

# Audit installed plugins
scc audit plugins

# See configuration sources
scc config explain
```
