<FAQSchema faqs={[
  { question: "Why should I sandbox Claude Code?", answer: "Claude Code executes commands on your system. Sandboxing limits what it can access—only mounted directories, controlled network access, and approved plugins. This reduces risk from AI mistakes or unexpected behavior." },
  { question: "What risks does sandboxing Claude Code prevent?", answer: "Sandboxing prevents: accidental file deletion outside your project, unintended git operations (force push, reset --hard), access to sensitive files (~/.ssh, ~/.aws), and installation of unapproved plugins or tools." },
  { question: "Is Claude Code dangerous without a sandbox?", answer: "Claude Code is designed to be helpful and follows safety guidelines. However, AI can make mistakes. Sandboxing adds defense-in-depth—even if Claude makes an error, the blast radius is limited to the sandbox." }

AI coding assistants like Claude Code execute real commands on real systems. This guide explains why sandboxing matters and when it's essential.

## The Reality of AI Code Execution

Claude Code is powerful because it can:
- Read and write files in your project
- Execute shell commands
- Run git operations
- Install dependencies
- Make API calls

This power comes with responsibility. While Claude Code is designed to be helpful and careful, any system that executes commands can cause unintended effects.

## Risks Without Sandboxing

### Filesystem Access

Without isolation, Claude Code can access any file your user account can access:

| Accessible | Risk |
|------------|------|
| `~/.ssh/` | SSH keys for servers and services |
| `~/.aws/` | AWS credentials |
| `~/.config/` | Application configurations |
| Other projects | Cross-project contamination |

With SCC, Claude Code only sees the workspace you explicitly mount.

### Git History Damage

AI coding sessions involve experimentation. Without guardrails:

| Command | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| `git push --force` | Overwrites remote history, affects entire team |
| `git reset --hard` | Discards uncommitted work |
| `git branch -D` | Force-deletes branches without merge check |
| `git clean -fd` | Deletes untracked files permanently |

SCC's Safety Net plugin blocks these commands by default.

### Configuration Drift

When each developer configures Claude Code independently:
- Plugins vary across the team
- Settings differ between machines
- Behavior is inconsistent and hard to debug

SCC provides team profiles that ensure consistent configuration.

## How Sandboxing Helps

### Docker Isolation

SCC runs Claude Code inside Docker containers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│          Host System            │
│  ~/.ssh  ~/.aws  ~/other-work   │
│           ▲                     │
│           │ (blocked)           │
│  ┌────────┴────────────────┐    │
│  │    Docker Container     │    │
│  │  /workspace (mounted)   │    │
│  │  Claude Code runs here  │    │
│  └─────────────────────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Claude Code can only access `/workspace`—your mounted project directory.

### Controlled Environment

SCC provides layers of control:

1. **What files**: Only mounted paths are visible
2. **What plugins**: Only org-approved plugins run
3. **What git ops**: Safety Net filters dangerous commands
4. **What network**: Network policies control outbound access

### Blast Radius Reduction

If something goes wrong, damage is contained:

| Without Sandbox | With SCC |
|-----------------|----------|
| Could affect entire system | Limited to mounted workspace |
| Could damage git history | Safety Net blocks destructive commands |
| Could install anything | Only approved plugins |
| Inconsistent recovery | Worktrees provide clean rollback |

## When Sandboxing Is Essential

### Enterprise Environments

- Multiple teams sharing AI tools
- Compliance requirements
- Need for audit trails
- Consistent security posture

### Sensitive Codebases

- Financial or healthcare systems
- Code with embedded secrets
- Production infrastructure

### Team Adoption

- Onboarding new developers
- Standardizing AI tool usage
- Reducing support burden from inconsistent setups

## When Sandboxing May Be Optional

### Solo Development
Individual developers with:
- Full system backups
- Git remotes as backup
- Understanding of risks

### Quick Experiments
One-off tests where:
- No sensitive data involved
- Results are disposable
- Speed matters more than safety

<Aside type="note">
  Even in these cases, sandboxing provides peace of mind. SCC's overhead is minimal once set up.

## Getting Started with Sandboxing

```bash
# Install SCC
uv tool install scc-cli

# Configure (one time)
scc setup

# Run sandboxed
scc start ~/your-project
```
