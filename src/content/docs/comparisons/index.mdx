SCC CLI takes a specific approach to running Claude Code: Docker-based sandboxing with centralized team governance. This section compares that approach to other common setups.

## What Makes SCC Different

SCC is purpose-built for running Claude Code in teams. It combines:

| Capability | What SCC Provides |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Docker Isolation** | Every session runs in a container—AI cannot access host files outside mounted paths |
| **Team Profiles** | Org admins define plugins, MCP servers, and policies; developers run `scc setup` once |
| **Git Worktrees** | Create isolated branches for each AI task without polluting main |
| **Safety Net** | Block destructive git commands like `push --force` and `reset --hard` |
| **Plugin Governance** | Approve or block plugins at the org level; teams cannot override security blocks |

## Which Approach Fits Your Needs?

| If you need... | Consider |
|----------------|----------|
| Maximum isolation and team governance | SCC CLI |
| Simple local development (solo) | Local Claude Code |
| Containerized IDE experience | Dev Containers + SCC or local Claude Code |
| Full control over Docker configuration | Manual Docker setup |
