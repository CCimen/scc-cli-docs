  { question: "Can I use SCC inside a dev container?", answer: "Yes. SCC requires Docker access, so your dev container needs Docker-in-Docker or access to the host Docker socket. SCC then creates its own containers for Claude Code sessions." },
  { question: "What does SCC provide that dev containers don't?", answer: "SCC adds Claude Code-specific features: Safety Net (blocks destructive git commands), plugin governance (org-approved plugins only), team profiles (consistent configs), and git worktree management. Dev containers provide general containerized development environments." },
  { question: "Should I use dev containers or SCC for AI coding?", answer: "They solve different problems. Dev containers standardize your development environment. SCC governs how Claude Code runs within that environment. Many teams use both together." }

This guide compares SCC's purpose-built Claude Code sandboxing to using generic dev containers for AI-assisted development.

## Different Goals

**Dev Containers** standardize your entire development environment—language runtimes, tools, extensions, and settings—in a reproducible container.

**SCC** specifically governs how Claude Code runs: isolation, plugin control, git safety, and team policies. It focuses on the AI coding assistant, not your full dev environment.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | SCC CLI | Dev Containers |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Primary purpose** | Sandbox and govern Claude Code | Standardize dev environment |
| **Scope** | Claude Code sessions only | Full development workflow |
| **Claude-specific features** | Safety Net, plugin governance, worktrees | None (runs Claude Code normally) |
| **Configuration** | Org/team JSON configs | devcontainer.json |
| **IDE integration** | CLI-based | VS Code, JetBrains, Codespaces |

## What SCC Provides

SCC focuses on Claude Code governance:

### Safety Net Plugin
Blocks destructive git commands that could damage your repository:
- `git push --force`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git branch -D`
- `git clean -fd`

### Plugin Governance
Organizations control which Claude Code plugins developers can use:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "blocked_plugins": ["*experimental*", "*beta*"]
  },
  "defaults": {
    "enabled_plugins": ["scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"]
  }
}
```

### Team Profiles
Consistent Claude Code configuration across all team members:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "backend": {
      "additional_plugins": ["java-analyzer@internal"],
      "session": { "timeout_hours": 8 }
    }
  }
}
```

### Git Worktree Management
Built-in isolation for parallel AI tasks:

```bash
scc worktree create ~/project feature-auth
# AI work happens on isolated branch
```

## What Dev Containers Provide

Dev containers standardize your full development environment:

- Language runtimes and versions
- Build tools and dependencies
- VS Code extensions
- Editor settings
- Port forwarding

Dev containers don't provide Claude Code-specific governance—Claude Code runs inside them the same way it runs on your host.

## Using Both Together

Many teams combine both approaches:

1. **Dev Container** defines the development environment (Node.js version, tools, extensions)
2. **SCC** governs Claude Code sessions within that environment

```bash
# Inside your dev container
scc setup --org https://example.com/org-config.json
scc start .
```

<Aside type="note">
  Running SCC inside a dev container requires Docker access. Configure Docker-in-Docker or mount the host Docker socket in your devcontainer.json.

## When to Use Each

### Choose SCC When

- Your priority is governing Claude Code specifically
- You need Safety Net to protect against destructive git commands
- Organization must control Claude Code plugins
- Team needs consistent Claude Code policies (not just dev environment)

### Choose Dev Containers When

- Your priority is standardizing the overall dev environment
- You need reproducible builds and consistent tooling
- IDE integration (VS Code, Codespaces) is important
- Claude Code governance isn't a concern

### Use Both When

- You want standardized dev environments AND Claude Code governance
- Your org has both general dev standards and AI-specific policies
- Different teams need different Claude Code configurations within similar dev environments
