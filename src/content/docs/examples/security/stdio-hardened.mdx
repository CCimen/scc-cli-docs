Enable stdio MCP servers with strict path controls.

## Configuration

```json title="org-config.json"
{
  "security": {
    "allow_stdio_mcp": true,
    "allowed_stdio_prefixes": [
      "/usr/local/bin/",
      "/opt/approved-tools/"
    ]
  }
}
```

Only commands in approved paths can run as stdio MCP servers.
