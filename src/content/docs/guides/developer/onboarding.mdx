Welcome to your new team! This guide explains what SCC provides automatically and how to get started.

## What You Get Automatically

When you run `scc setup` and select your team profile, you automatically receive:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Approved Plugins" icon="puzzle">
    Your team's approved Claude Code plugins, pre-configured and ready to use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Servers" icon="server">
    Access to MCP servers like context7, shadcn, or team-specific tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security Policies" icon="shield">
    Organization security policies applied automatically—no action needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Command Guardrails" icon="warning">
    Safety-net protection against destructive git commands (if enabled).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What You Never Need to Do

- Edit config files manually
- Download or configure plugins
- Worry about security settings
- Set up MCP server connections

Your org admin and team lead handle all configuration. You just code.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
1. **Install SCC CLI**

   ```bash
   pip install scc-cli
   ```

2. **Run setup and enter your org URL**

   ```bash
   scc setup
   ```

   Your team lead or org admin will provide the URL. It looks like:
   - `https://github.com/my-org/scc-config/raw/main/org-config.json`
   - `https://gitlab.example.com/devops/scc-config.json`

3. **Select your team profile**

   You'll see a list of available teams. Pick yours:
   ```
   Available teams:
   1. backend
   2. frontend
   3. platform

   Select team: 1
   ```

4. **Verify your setup**

   ```bash
   scc doctor
   ```

5. **Start coding!**

   ```bash
   cd ~/your-project
   scc
   ```
</Steps>

## Understanding Your Configuration

To see what your team profile includes:

```bash
# List teams
scc team

# Show current team settings
scc team info <team-name>

# Show full effective configuration with sources
scc config explain
```

<Aside type="tip">
  The `scc config explain` command shows where each setting comes from (org, team, or project), which is helpful for understanding why something is configured a certain way.
</Aside>

## Switching Teams

If you work on multiple teams:

```bash
# List available teams
scc team

# Switch to a different team interactively
scc team switch

# Or switch directly
scc team switch frontend
```

<Aside type="note">
  Team switches only affect new sessions. Existing sessions keep their original team configuration.
</Aside>

## Project-Specific Configuration

You can add a `.scc.yaml` file to your repository for project-specific settings:

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Add plugins specific to this project
additional_plugins:
  - "project-linter@internal"

# Override session settings
session:
  timeout_hours: 4
```

<Aside type="caution">
  You can only **add** plugins within patterns your team allows. You cannot override organization security blocks or remove team defaults.
</Aside>

## Personal Profiles (Optional)

If you want your own tweaks (plugins or MCP servers) without committing anything to the repo, use personal profiles:

```bash
scc profile save
scc profile apply
```

These live outside the repo and can be synced across machines. See [Personal Profiles](/guides/developer/personal-profiles/).

## Common First-Day Tasks

### Clone and Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/my-org/my-project.git
cd my-project
scc
```

### Resume Yesterday's Session

```bash
scc start --resume
# or
scc start --select  # Pick from recent sessions
```

### Create a Feature Branch Worktree

```bash
scc worktree create ~/my-project feature-auth
scc worktree enter feature-auth
```

## Getting Help

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check your setup | `scc doctor` |
| See your team config | `scc team info` |
| See effective config | `scc config explain` |
| List recent sessions | `scc sessions` |

If something is blocked or doesn't work as expected, talk to your team lead first—they can often resolve plugin or permission issues.
