The Settings & Maintenance TUI provides a visual interface for managing SCC's configuration, clearing cache, and performing maintenance operations.

## Accessing Settings

Press `s` from the main dashboard to open the Settings & Maintenance screen.

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Open Settings & Maintenance from dashboard |
| `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` | Navigate actions |
| `←`/`→` or `h`/`l` | Switch categories |
| `Enter` | Execute action |
| `p` | Preview affected paths and sizes |
| `?` | Show help panel |
| `Esc` | Go back / Close panels |

## Categories

The Settings TUI is organized into three categories:

### Maintenance

System cleanup and data management operations.

### Diagnostics

Health checks and debugging tools.

### About

Version information and file locations.

## Maintenance Actions

Each action has a risk tier that determines the confirmation level:

| Action | Risk | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Clear cache | <Badge text="Safe" variant="success" /> | Remove regenerable cache files |
| Clear contexts | <Badge text="Changes State" variant="note" /> | Clear recent work contexts |
| Prune containers | <Badge text="Changes State" variant="note" /> | Remove stopped Docker containers |
| Prune sessions | <Badge text="Changes State" variant="note" /> | Remove old sessions (keeps recent 20) |
| Reset exceptions | <Badge text="Destructive" variant="caution" /> | Clear all policy exceptions |
| Delete all sessions | <Badge text="Destructive" variant="caution" /> | Remove entire session history |
| Reset configuration | <Badge text="Destructive" variant="caution" /> | Reset to defaults (requires setup) |
| Factory reset | <Badge text="Very Destructive" variant="danger" /> | Remove all SCC data |

## Risk-Tiered Confirmations

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Tier 0 (Safe)">
  Actions like "Clear cache" execute immediately with just a success toast.

  No confirmation required — these operations are always safe to run.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tier 1 (Changes State)">
  Actions like "Clear contexts" or "Prune containers" show a simple Y/N confirmation.

  ```
  This will clear work contexts. Continue? [y/N]
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tier 2 (Destructive)">
  Actions like "Reset configuration" show an impact preview before confirming.

  ```
  This will reset configuration.

  Affected: ~/.config/scc/config.json
  You will need to run 'scc setup' again.

  Continue? [y/N]
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tier 3 (Factory Reset)">
  Factory reset requires typing "FACTORY RESET" to confirm.

  ```
  ⚠️  FACTORY RESET will remove ALL SCC data:
  - Configuration
  - Sessions
  - Exceptions
  - Cache

  Type "FACTORY RESET" to confirm:
  ```

  <Aside type="caution">
    This is case-insensitive — "factory reset" also works.
  </Aside>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Preview Mode

Press `p` on any action to see exactly what will be affected:

```
Clear cache

Paths affected:
  ~/.cache/scc/

Current size: 15.7 KB
```

This lets you understand the impact before executing.

## Common Workflows

<Steps>
1. **Quick cleanup after heavy usage**

   Open settings (`s`), select "Clear cache", press Enter.

2. **Starting fresh with a new organization**

   Open settings (`s`), select "Reset configuration", confirm, then run `scc setup`.

3. **Cleaning up old sessions**

   Open settings (`s`), select "Prune sessions" to keep only the 20 most recent per team.
</Steps>

## CLI Alternative

All TUI actions are also available via CLI:

```bash
# Clear cache
scc reset --cache

# Clear contexts
scc reset --contexts

# Prune sessions
scc reset --sessions

# Factory reset
scc reset --all
```

See [scc reset](/reference/cli/admin/#scc-reset) for all CLI options.
