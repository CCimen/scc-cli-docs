You can add a `.scc.yaml` file to your repository root to customize SCC settings for that specific project.

## When to Use Project Config

Use `.scc.yaml` when you need:
- Project-specific plugins
- Custom session timeouts
- Entry directory overrides
- Team pinning for the project

<Aside type="note">
  Project configuration **extends** your team config. You cannot override organization security blocks or remove team defaults.
</Aside>

## File Location

<FileTree>
- my-project/
  - .scc.yaml  **← Project config**
  - .git/
  - src/
  - package.json
</FileTree>

## Basic Structure

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Add plugins specific to this project
additional_plugins:
  - "eslint-plugin@internal"
  - "project-linter@team-marketplace"

# Override session settings
session:
  timeout_hours: 4

# Pin this project to a specific team
team: backend
```

## Available Options

### Additional Plugins

Add plugins beyond what your team provides:

```yaml
additional_plugins:
  - "plugin-name@marketplace"
  - "another-plugin@marketplace"
```

<Aside type="caution">
  You can only add plugins that match your team's `allow_additional_plugins` patterns. Attempts to add disallowed plugins will be blocked.
</Aside>

### Session Settings

Override session behavior:

```yaml
session:
  timeout_hours: 4      # Override team default
  auto_resume: false    # Disable auto-resume
```

### Team Pinning

Force a specific team profile for this project:

```yaml
team: security
```

When developers open this project with `scc`, it will use the security team's configuration regardless of their default team.

### Entry Directory

Specify a different entry point:

```yaml
entry_directory: ./packages/frontend
```

Claude Code will start in this directory instead of the project root.

## Example Configurations

### Monorepo Frontend Package

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Pin to frontend team
team: frontend

# Start in the frontend package
entry_directory: ./packages/frontend

# Add React-specific tooling
additional_plugins:
  - "react-tools@frontend-marketplace"

session:
  timeout_hours: 8
```

### Security-Sensitive Project

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Force security team config (strictest settings)
team: security

# Short sessions for sensitive work
session:
  timeout_hours: 2
  auto_resume: false
```

### Data Science Project

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Use ML team profile
team: ml-team

# Longer sessions for training runs
session:
  timeout_hours: 24

# Add data science plugins
additional_plugins:
  - "jupyter-helper@ml-marketplace"
  - "pandas-tools@ml-marketplace"
```

## Validation

Validate your project config:

```bash
scc config validate
```

This checks:
- YAML syntax is correct
- Referenced plugins are allowed
- Team exists (if pinned)
- All settings are recognized

## Seeing Effective Config

To see how project config combines with team and org settings:

```bash
scc config explain
```

Output shows the source of each setting:

```
Effective configuration for ~/project:

plugins:
  - scc-safety-net        (from: team/backend)
  - code-formatter        (from: team/backend)
  - eslint-plugin         (from: project/.scc.yaml)  ← Project addition

session:
  timeout_hours: 4        (from: project/.scc.yaml)  ← Project override
  auto_resume: true       (from: team/backend)

network_policy: corp-proxy-only (from: org/defaults)
```

## What You Cannot Override

Project config cannot:

- Remove team default plugins
- Unblock organization-blocked plugins
- Override network policy (if org restricts it)
- Bypass security settings

<Aside type="danger">
  Organization security blocks are absolute. Even if you try to add a blocked plugin in `.scc.yaml`, it will be filtered out.
</Aside>

## Git Ignore Considerations

The `.scc.yaml` file should typically be committed to your repository so all team members get the same project settings.

However, if you have personal overrides, you can create a local file:

```bash
# Add to .git/info/exclude (not committed)
.scc.local.yaml
```

<Aside type="note">
  Local overrides (`.scc.local.yaml`) are only supported if your team enables `allow_project_overrides: true`.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### "Plugin not allowed"

Your team's delegation rules don't permit that plugin. Check with your team lead.

```bash
scc config explain --field delegation
```

### "Team not found"

The pinned team doesn't exist in your org config. Verify the team name:

```bash
scc team list
```

### Changes not taking effect

Project config is read at session start. Restart your session:

```bash
scc stop
scc start --fresh
```
