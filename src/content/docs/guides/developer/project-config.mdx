You can add a `.scc.yaml` file to your repository root to customize SCC settings for that specific project.

## When to Use Project Config

Use `.scc.yaml` when you need:
- Project-specific plugins
- Project-specific MCP servers
- Custom session timeouts (auto_resume is advisory)

<Aside type="note">
  Project configuration **extends** your team config. You cannot override organization security blocks or remove team defaults.
</Aside>

## File Location

<FileTree>
- my-project/
  - .scc.yaml  **← Project config**
  - .git/
  - src/
  - package.json
</FileTree>

## Basic Structure

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Add plugins specific to this project
additional_plugins:
  - "eslint-plugin@internal"
  - "project-linter@team-marketplace"

# Optional MCP servers for this project
additional_mcp_servers:
  - name: "project-api"
    type: "sse"
    url: "https://api.example.com/mcp"

# Override session settings
session:
  timeout_hours: 4
```

<Aside type="note">
  `.scc.yaml` does not select a team. Use `scc team switch` or `scc start --team`.
</Aside>

## Available Options

### Additional Plugins

Add plugins beyond what your team provides:

```yaml
additional_plugins:
  - "plugin-name@marketplace"
  - "another-plugin@marketplace"
```

<Aside type="caution">
  You can only add plugins that match `defaults.allowed_plugins` (if set) and pass org security blocks. Attempts to add disallowed plugins will be blocked.
</Aside>

### Session Settings

Override session behavior:

```yaml
session:
  timeout_hours: 4      # Override team default
  auto_resume: false    # Advisory only in v1
```

<Aside type="note">
  `session.auto_resume` is accepted but advisory in v1. It is not enforced at runtime.
</Aside>

### Additional MCP Servers

Add MCP servers scoped to this project:

```yaml
additional_mcp_servers:
  - name: project-api
    type: sse
    url: https://api.example.com/mcp
```

<Aside type="note">
  MCP servers must pass org security blocks and `defaults.allowed_mcp_servers` (if set). Plugin-bundled MCP servers are not inspected.
</Aside>

## Example Configurations

### Monorepo Frontend Package

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Add React-specific tooling
additional_plugins:
  - "react-tools@frontend-marketplace"

session:
  timeout_hours: 8
```

### Security-Sensitive Project

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Short sessions for sensitive work
session:
  timeout_hours: 2
  auto_resume: false
```

### Data Science Project

```yaml title=".scc.yaml"
# Longer sessions for training runs
session:
  timeout_hours: 24

# Add data science plugins
additional_plugins:
  - "jupyter-helper@ml-marketplace"
  - "pandas-tools@ml-marketplace"
```

## Validation

Validate your project config:

```bash
scc config validate
```

This checks:
- YAML syntax is correct
- Referenced plugins/MCP servers are allowed
- Project delegation rules are satisfied
- Selected team exists in org config
- Unknown keys are reported (ignored at runtime)

<Aside type="note">
  Validation uses your current team (set via `scc team switch`) unless you pass `--team`.
</Aside>

## Seeing Effective Config

To see how project config combines with team and org settings:

```bash
scc config explain
```

Output shows the source of each setting:

```
Effective configuration for ~/project:

plugins:
  - scc-safety-net        (from: team/backend)
  - code-formatter        (from: team/backend)
  - eslint-plugin         (from: project/.scc.yaml)  ← Project addition

session:
  timeout_hours: 4        (from: project/.scc.yaml)  ← Project override
  auto_resume: true       (from: team/backend, advisory)

network_policy: corp-proxy-only (from: org/defaults)
```

## What You Cannot Override

Project config cannot:

- Remove team default plugins
- Unblock organization-blocked plugins
- Override network policy (projects cannot set it; teams can only tighten org defaults)
- Bypass security settings

<Aside type="danger">
  Organization security blocks are absolute. Even if you try to add a blocked plugin in `.scc.yaml`, it will be filtered out.
</Aside>

## Git Ignore Considerations

The `.scc.yaml` file should typically be committed to your repository so all team members get the same project settings.

Local-only overrides are not supported in v1. Use personal profiles for machine-specific plugins or MCP servers.

## Personal Profiles (Local)

If you want your own plugins or MCP servers without committing anything to the repo, use **personal profiles**.

```bash
scc profile save
scc profile apply
```

Personal profiles live outside the repo and can be synced across machines. See [Personal Profiles](/guides/developer/personal-profiles/) for details.

<Aside type="note">
  When SCC applies a profile, it enforces org security blocks and stdio MCP gating. Manual edits
  to local workspace files are advisory.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### "Plugin not allowed"

Your team's delegation rules don't permit that plugin. Check with your team lead.

```bash
scc config explain --field denied
```

### "Team not found"

Your selected team no longer exists in the org config. Pick a valid team:

```bash
scc team list
scc team switch <team>
```

### Changes not taking effect

Project config is read at session start. Restart your session:

```bash
scc stop
scc start --fresh
```
