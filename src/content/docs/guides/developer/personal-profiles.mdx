Personal profiles let you keep **your own** Claude Code preferences per project, on top of your organization and team configuration. They are stored outside the repository and automatically applied when you start a session.

## Quick Access

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="TUI (Visual)" icon="laptop">
    Press `p` in dashboard or go to **Settings → Profiles**
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI (Terminal)" icon="terminal">
    Use `scc profile` commands below
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What This Solves

- You want extra plugins or MCP servers for your workflow
- You tweak settings locally and want them to persist across sessions
- You work on multiple machines and want to sync your personal setup
- You switch teams often but still want your **personal taste** per project

Personal profiles are **optional**. When SCC applies a profile, it enforces org security
blocks (`blocked_*`) and stdio MCP gating. Manual edits to
`.claude/settings.local.json` or `.mcp.json` are detected as **drift**—SCC will warn you
and require confirmation before overwriting (use `--force` in non-interactive mode to skip the prompt).

<Aside type="tip">
  Think of this as your per‑project “personal taste” layer. You still benefit from org + team defaults, while keeping your own tweaks portable.
</Aside>

## Configuration Layers

SCC merges settings in this order:

**Organization → Team → Personal Profile (project) → Workspace overrides**

<Aside type="note">
  Workspace overrides are the files inside the repo: `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.mcp.json`.
  SCC tracks drift to avoid overwriting your local edits.

## TUI Integration

The Settings TUI provides visual profile management without memorizing CLI commands.

### Accessing Profiles in TUI

**Method 1: Quick Menu**
- Press `p` from the dashboard to open the profile quick menu
- Options: Save, Apply, Show diff, Open in Settings

**Method 2: Settings Screen**
- Press `s` to open Settings & Maintenance
- Navigate to the **Profiles** tab
- Actions: Save profile, Apply profile, Show diff, Sync profiles

### Sync Profiles via TUI

The **Sync profiles** action opens an overlay picker:

```
› 📁 ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles  Change path
  Export                      Save profiles to folder
  Import                      Load profiles from folder
  Full sync                   Load then save  (advanced)
```

<Aside type="note">
TUI sync writes files locally only—no git commit or push. Use the CLI with `--commit --push` flags for git operations.
</Aside>

**Import Preview:** Before importing, you'll see a preview of what will change:
- `+` (green) — New profiles to add
- `~` (yellow) — Existing profiles to update
- `·` (dim) — Unchanged profiles

## Save a Personal Profile

Capture your current workspace settings into a personal profile:

```bash
scc profile save
```

If you installed plugins inside the container and they only exist in sandbox settings, SCC will detect them and offer to import them into `.claude/settings.local.json` before saving.

This saves into:

```
~/.config/scc/personal/projects/<hash>.json
```

## Apply or Preview

```bash
# Apply profile to current workspace
scc profile apply

# Preview diff without writing
scc profile apply --preview
```

If SCC detects local drift, it will offer a preview diff before applying (or require `--force` in non-interactive mode).

## Inspect Differences

```bash
scc profile diff
```

## Status and Drift

```bash
scc profile status
```

This shows whether a profile exists, when it was last applied, and if local drift is detected.

## List Profiles

```bash
scc profile list
```

## Sync Across Machines (Repo-Based)

SCC can export/import profiles to any local git repo (GitHub, GitLab, or private repos all work).

```bash
# Export all profiles to a repo path
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles

# Import profiles from a repo path
scc profile import --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles
```

Preview import without writing:

```bash
scc profile import --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --preview
```

Optional commit/push:

```bash
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --commit
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --commit --push
```

Sync shortcut:

```bash
scc profile sync --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --pull --commit --push
```

<Aside type="tip">
  SCC will never create remote repos or choose hosting providers for you. You control where the repo lives.

## Recommended Workflow

Use this flow if you move between computers or just want a reliable "personal taste" layer per project.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TUI Workflow">
<Steps>
1. **Make your changes**

   Install plugins or edit settings inside the container.

2. **Save your profile**

   Press `p` → Save current settings (or Settings → Profiles → Save profile)

3. **Export to your sync folder**

   Settings → Profiles → Sync profiles → Export

4. **On a new machine**

   Settings → Profiles → Sync profiles → Import

   Then just run `scc start` in the project—your personal profile auto‑applies.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

**“Invalid JSON”**

Your `.claude/settings.local.json` or `.mcp.json` file has invalid JSON. Fix the file before saving or applying profiles.

**“No personal profile found”**

Run `scc profile save` in the project to create one.
