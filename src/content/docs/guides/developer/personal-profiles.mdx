Personal profiles let you keep **your own** Claude Code preferences per project, on top of your team configuration. They are stored outside the repository and automatically applied when you start a session.

## What This Solves

- You want extra plugins or MCP servers for your workflow
- You tweak settings locally and want them to persist across sessions
- You work on multiple machines and want to sync your personal setup

Personal profiles are **optional** and never override org security rules.

## Configuration Layers

SCC merges settings in this order:

**Organization → Team → Personal Profile (project) → Workspace overrides**

<Aside type="note">
  Workspace overrides are the files inside the repo: `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.mcp.json`.
  SCC tracks drift to avoid overwriting your local edits.
</Aside>

## Save a Personal Profile

Capture your current workspace settings into a personal profile:

```bash
scc profile save
```

This saves into:

```
~/.config/scc/personal/projects/<hash>.json
```

## Apply or Preview

```bash
# Apply profile to current workspace
scc profile apply

# Preview diff without writing
scc profile apply --preview
```

If SCC detects local drift, it will prompt before applying (or require `--force` in non-interactive mode).

## Inspect Differences

```bash
scc profile diff
```

## Status and Drift

```bash
scc profile status
```

This shows whether a profile exists, when it was last applied, and if local drift is detected.

## List Profiles

```bash
scc profile list
```

## Sync Across Machines (Repo-Based)

SCC can export/import profiles to any local git repo (GitHub, GitLab, or private repos all work).

```bash
# Export all profiles to a repo path
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles

# Import profiles from a repo path
scc profile import --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles
```

Preview import without writing:

```bash
scc profile import --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --preview
```

Optional commit/push:

```bash
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --commit
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --commit --push
```

Sync shortcut:

```bash
scc profile sync --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --pull --commit --push
```

<Aside type="tip">
  SCC will never create remote repos or choose hosting providers for you. You control where the repo lives.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

**“Invalid JSON”**

Your `.claude/settings.local.json` or `.mcp.json` file has invalid JSON. Fix the file before saving or applying profiles.

**“No personal profile found”**

Run `scc profile save` in the project to create one.
