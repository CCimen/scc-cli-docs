This guide covers the most common SCC commands and patterns you'll use day-to-day.

## Starting Your Day

### Quick Resume

If you have a recent session for your current project:

```bash
cd ~/project
scc
```

SCC will show the Quick Resume picker if sessions exist:

```
Recent sessions for ~/project:
  1. feature-auth (2 hours ago)
  2. bugfix-login (yesterday)

[Enter] Resume selected  [n] New session  [q] Quit
```

### Force a New Session

```bash
scc start --fresh
```

This creates a new container even if you have existing sessions.

### Resume Without Prompts

```bash
scc start --resume
```

Automatically resumes the most recent session for this workspace.

## Working with Multiple Projects

### Project A in the Morning

```bash
cd ~/project-a
scc
# Work on project A...
# Press Ctrl+D or type 'exit' to leave
```

### Project B in the Afternoon

```bash
cd ~/project-b
scc
# Different session, different container
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Each project has its own session history. SCC tracks sessions by workspace root.
</Aside>

## Managing Sessions

### List Recent Sessions

```bash
scc sessions
```

Output:
```
Workspace: ~/project-a
  - feature-auth (running) - started 2h ago
  - bugfix-login (stopped) - 1d ago

Workspace: ~/project-b
  - main (stopped) - 3h ago
```

### Stop All Running Containers

```bash
scc stop
```

### Stop a Specific Session

```bash
scc stop --session feature-auth
```

## Using Git Worktrees

### Create a Worktree for a New Feature

<Steps>
1. **Create the worktree**

   ```bash
   scc worktree create ~/project feature-payments
   ```

   This creates:
   - Directory: `~/project/.worktrees/feature-payments`
   - Branch: `scc/feature-payments`

2. **Enter the worktree**

   ```bash
   scc worktree enter feature-payments
   ```

   This opens a subshell in the worktree directory.

3. **Start SCC in the worktree**

   ```bash
   scc
   ```

4. **Exit when done**

   ```bash
   exit  # Leave the worktree subshell
   ```
</Steps>

### List All Worktrees

```bash
scc worktree list -v
```

Output with status indicators:
```
~/project/.worktrees/feature-payments [scc/feature-payments]
  +2 !1 ?3  (2 staged, 1 modified, 3 untracked)

~/project/.worktrees/bugfix-auth [scc/bugfix-auth]
  .  (clean)
```

### Switch Between Worktrees

```bash
# Enter a different worktree
scc worktree enter bugfix-auth

# Or use the interactive picker
scc worktree select
```

### Quick Navigation Shortcuts

```bash
scc worktree enter ^    # Enter main branch worktree
scc worktree enter -    # Enter previous worktree (like cd -)
```

## Team Switching

### Temporary Team Override

Sometimes you need to work as a different team for one session:

```bash
scc start --team security ~/project
```

This uses the security team's profile for this session only.

<Aside type="note">
  The `--team` flag is session-only. Your default team remains unchanged.
</Aside>

### Permanent Team Switch

```bash
scc team switch
# Select new team interactively
```

Or directly:

```bash
scc team switch frontend
```

## Debugging Configuration

### See Effective Configuration

```bash
scc config explain
```

This shows every setting and where it came from:
```
plugins:
  - scc-safety-net (from: team/backend)
  - code-linter (from: project/.scc.yaml)

network_policy: corp-proxy-only (from: org/defaults)
```

### Check Why Something is Blocked

```bash
scc config explain --field plugins
```

## Non-Interactive Mode (CI/Scripts)

For automation, use flags to avoid prompts:

```bash
# Will fail instead of prompting
scc start --non-interactive ~/project

# Preview configuration as JSON
scc start --dry-run --json

# Combine for CI pipelines
scc start --dry-run --json --non-interactive ~/project
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `Enter` | Session picker | Select/resume |
| `n` | Session picker | New session |
| `Esc` | Any picker | Go back |
| `q` | Any picker | Quit |
| `t` | Workspace picker | Switch teams |

## Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Session won't resume" | Container may have been pruned; start fresh |
| "Quick Resume not showing" | Sessions only show for exact workspace path |
| "Team switch not taking effect" | Switches only affect new sessions |
