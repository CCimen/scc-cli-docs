import { Aside, Steps, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The explain wizard helps you understand SCC configuration behavior, why plugins are blocked or denied, and how inheritance works.

## Quick Start

```
/scc-wizard:explain
```

Then ask questions like:
- "Why is plugin X blocked for team Y?"
- "What's the effective config for team backend?"
- "Why didn't my team config changes take effect?"

## Response Format

The wizard gives short answers first with copy/paste fixes:

```
Short answer: Plugin X is denied because team 'backend' is not in
delegation.teams.allow_additional_plugins.

To fix: Add "backend" to delegation.teams.allow_additional_plugins

Want full reasoning? [y/N]
```

## What Can I Ask?

### "Why is plugin X blocked?"

The wizard checks in order:

1. Does it match `security.blocked_plugins`? → **Blocked** (immutable)
2. Does it match `defaults.disabled_plugins`? → **Disabled** (can re-enable)
3. Is team not in `delegation.teams.allow_additional_plugins`? → **Denied**
4. Does it not match `defaults.allowed_plugins`? → **Denied**

### "Why is MCP server X blocked?"

Checks in order:

1. Does it match `security.blocked_mcp_servers`? → **Blocked**
2. Is it stdio type and `allow_stdio_mcp = false`? → **Blocked**
3. Is stdio command not absolute path? → **Blocked**
4. Is stdio command outside `allowed_stdio_prefixes`? → **Blocked**
5. Is team not in `delegation.teams.allow_additional_mcp_servers`? → **Denied**
6. Does URL not match `defaults.allowed_mcp_servers`? → **Denied**

### "What's the effective config for team X?"

Shows the final computed configuration after all merges:

1. Org defaults applied
2. Team profile additions
3. Security boundaries enforced
4. What actually runs

### "Explain delegation for team X"

Shows:
- Team's position in delegation allowlists
- Whether project overrides are enabled
- What the team can and cannot add

## Blocked vs Denied vs Disabled

| Term | Meaning | Can Fix? | Source |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Blocked** | Security boundary | No | `security.blocked_*` |
| **Denied** | Governance decision | Yes | Delegation or allowlist |
| **Disabled** | Removed from defaults | Yes | `defaults.disabled_plugins` |

<Aside type="tip">
**Blocked** is immutable - you cannot bypass it. **Denied** and **Disabled** can be changed by updating the config.
</Aside>

## Copy/Paste Fixes

The wizard provides ready-to-use JSON snippets:

### Allow a Plugin Pattern

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "allowed_plugins": ["*@official-plugins", "core-*"]
  }
}
```

### Delegate Plugin Additions to a Team

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "teams": {
      "allow_additional_plugins": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Enable Project Overrides

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "projects": { "inherit_team_delegation": true }
  }
}
```

Then for the specific team:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "backend": {
      "delegation": { "allow_project_overrides": true }
    }
  }
}
```

### Grant Team Marketplace Trust

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "ai-team": {
      "trust": {
        "allow_additional_marketplaces": true,
        "marketplace_source_patterns": ["https://github.com/myorg/*"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Inheritance Model

SCC merges configs in layers:

```
Layer 1: Org config (org-v1)
   ↓ (apply defaults)
Layer 2: Team profile OR team-managed team-config
   ↓ (if delegation allows)
Layer 3: Project .scc.yaml additions
   ↓
Effective config (what actually runs)
```

### Merge Rules by Field

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `enabled_plugins` | Accumulate (union) |
| `disabled_plugins` | Remove from enabled |
| `additional_mcp_servers` | Accumulate |
| `security.blocked_*` | Immutable, all layers |
| `session.timeout_hours` | Last-wins |
| `network_policy` | Org defaults only |
| `cache_ttl_hours` | Org defaults only |

<Aside type="caution">
Team-level `network_policy` and `session.auto_resume` exist in the schema but are **not applied** by the current runtime. These only work as org defaults.
</Aside>

## Common Questions

### "Why didn't my team config changes take effect?"

Check:
1. Is your team team-managed? (`config_source` must exist)
2. Is `config_source` URL correct and accessible?
3. Has the cache expired?
4. Are plugins formatted as `plugin@marketplace`?
5. Does the marketplace exist?

**Quick fix if config seems stale:**

```bash
rm ~/.cache/scc/org_config.json ~/.cache/scc/cache_meta.json
```

Then rerun your command.

### "Why is blocked_mcp_servers not blocking a plugin's MCP?"

`security.blocked_mcp_servers` only checks **explicitly-declared** MCP servers in org/team/project configs. It does not inspect MCP servers bundled inside marketplace plugins.
