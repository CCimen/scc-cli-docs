The org config wizard helps you create, edit, and migrate SCC organization configurations with a success-first approach.

## Quick Start

```
/scc-wizard:org
```

Choose **Quickstart** to get a working config in ~60 seconds.

## Setup Modes

### Quickstart (Recommended)

Get a minimal working config with just 2 inputs:

<Steps>
1. Select "Create new org config (Quickstart)"
2. Provide your organization name
3. Review the generated config
4. Optionally add features via the add-ons menu
</Steps>

**What you get:**
- Official plugins marketplace configured
- scc-safety-net enabled
- Balanced security defaults
- Ready to host and use

### Guided Setup

Same baseline as Quickstart, then choose add-ons:

- Add teams/profiles
- Add an internal marketplace
- Allow project overrides
- Generate onboarding instructions
- Customize security settings

### Advanced Mode

Full control over every setting from the start:
- Security presets (Balanced/Strict/Open/Custom)
- Delegation rules
- Allowlists and blocklists
- All team/profile options

## The Baseline Config

Every new config starts with this minimal, working baseline:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://scc-cli.dev/schemas/org-v1.json",
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "organization": {
    "name": "Your Org",
    "id": "your-org"
  },
  "marketplaces": {
    "sandboxed-code-official": {
      "source": "github",
      "owner": "CCimen",
      "repo": "sandboxed-code-plugins",
      "branch": "main",
      "path": "/"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "enabled_plugins": ["scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"]
  },
  "security": {
    "safety_net": { "action": "block" }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
The baseline is intentionally minimal. Add complexity only when needed via the add-ons menu.
</Aside>

## Adding Teams

When you choose "Add teams/profiles", you'll decide the governance model:

### Org-managed (Recommended to Start)

The org admin controls plugin lists for all teams. No extra files needed.

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "backend": {
      "description": "Backend team",
      "additional_plugins": ["java-analyzer@internal"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Single file to manage
- Fast onboarding
- Teams can still own plugin *content* via internal marketplaces

### Team-managed (Recommended for Scale)

Each team maintains their own `team-config.json` file.

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "platform": {
      "config_source": {
        "source": "github",
        "owner": "your-org",
        "repo": "scc-team-configs",
        "branch": "main",
        "path": "teams/platform/team-config.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Teams self-service their plugin lists
- Org still enforces security boundaries
- Better for large organizations

<Aside type="note">
The wizard handles all the `config_source` and `trust` settings automatically when you choose team-managed.
</Aside>

## Update Mode

To edit an existing config:

<Steps>
1. Run `/scc-wizard:org`
2. Select "Update an existing org config file"
3. Provide the path (default: `./org-config.json`)
4. Choose which section to edit
5. Save when done
</Steps>

## Migration Mode

To move teams from org-managed to team-managed:

<Steps>
1. Run `/scc-wizard:org`
2. Select "Migrate org-managed teams → team-managed configs"
3. Load your existing config
4. Select which teams to migrate
5. Provide hosting details (GitHub/GitLab/HTTPS)
6. Wizard generates:
   - Updated org config with `config_source` entries
   - Starter team-config.json files for each team
</Steps>

## Onboarding Instructions

After creating your config, generate onboarding instructions:

<Steps>
1. Select "Generate onboarding instructions"
2. Choose where you'll host the config (GitHub/GitLab/HTTPS)
3. Indicate if the repo is public or private
4. Get the hosting URL and setup command
</Steps>

**Example output (public GitHub):**

```
1. Host org-config.json at:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/scc-config/main/org-config.json

2. Users run:
   scc setup --org https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/scc-config/main/org-config.json
```

**For private repos:**

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> scc setup --org https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/scc-config/main/org-config.json
```

## Tips

### Naming Conventions

| Field | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `organization.id` | lowercase, hyphens only | `acme-corp` |
| Team names | lowercase, hyphens only | `backend`, `ai-team` |
| Marketplace names | lowercase, hyphens | `sandboxed-code-official`, `internal` |

### Allowlist Gotchas

| Intent | JSON |
|--------|------|
| Allow all | **Omit the field entirely** |
| Block all | `[]` (empty array) |
| Allow patterns | `["core-*", "*@sandboxed-code-official"]` |

<Aside type="caution">
Omitting a field and setting it to `[]` have opposite effects. Omit to allow all; use `[]` to block all.
