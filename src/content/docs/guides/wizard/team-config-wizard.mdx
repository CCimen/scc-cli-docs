The team config wizard helps you create and edit `team-config.json` files for team-managed teams.

<Aside type="note">
You only need a team-config file if your team is **team-managed** (has `config_source` in the org config). Org-managed teams don't need separate files.
</Aside>

## Quick Start

```
/scc-wizard:team
```

## When Do I Need a Team Config?

### You Need a Team Config When:

- The org config has a `config_source` entry for your team
- You want to independently manage your team's plugin list

### You Don't Need a Team Config When:

- Your team is org-managed (no `config_source`)
- The org admin manages your plugins in `profiles.<team>.additional_plugins`

## Creating a Team Config

<Steps>
1. Run `/scc-wizard:team`
2. Select "Create new team config"
3. Provide team context (name, available marketplaces)
4. Add plugins to enable
5. Optionally add plugins to disable
6. Add team marketplaces (if trusted by org)
7. Review and save
</Steps>

### Example Output

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://scc-cli.dev/schemas/team-config.v1.json",
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "enabled_plugins": [
    "changelog-generator@sandboxed-code-official",
    "code-review@sandboxed-code-official"
  ],
  "disabled_plugins": [
    "legacy-tool@*"
  ]
}
```

## Plugin References

Always use the `plugin@marketplace` format:

```json
{
  "enabled_plugins": [
    "scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official",
    "java-analyzer@internal"
  ]
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
Reference plugins from marketplaces defined in the org config, or from team-defined marketplaces if your org grants that trust.
</Aside>

## Disabling Plugins

Use `disabled_plugins` to remove plugins from org defaults:

```json
{
  "disabled_plugins": [
    "legacy-tool@*",
    "*-deprecated"
  ]
}
```

This removes matching plugins from the org's `defaults.enabled_plugins`.

## Team Marketplaces

If your org grants marketplace trust (`trust.allow_additional_marketplaces: true`), you can define team-specific marketplaces:

```json
{
  "marketplaces": {
    "team-plugins": {
      "source": "github",
      "owner": "your-org",
      "repo": "team-plugins"
    }
  },
  "enabled_plugins": [
    "custom-tool@team-plugins"
  ]
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
If the org doesn't grant marketplace trust, you can only use org-defined marketplaces. The wizard will inform you if this is the case.
</Aside>

### Trust Settings in Org Config

For a team to add marketplaces, the org must grant trust:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "ai-team": {
      "config_source": { ... },
      "trust": {
        "inherit_org_marketplaces": true,
        "allow_additional_marketplaces": true,
        "marketplace_source_patterns": ["https://github.com/your-org/*"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Edit Mode

To update an existing team config:

<Steps>
1. Run `/scc-wizard:team`
2. Select "Edit existing team config"
3. Provide the file path
4. Choose what to modify:
   - Add/remove enabled plugins
   - Add/remove disabled patterns
   - Add/remove/edit marketplaces
5. Save changes
</Steps>

## Team-managed Checklist

After creating your team config, complete this checklist:

1. **Host the file** at the path specified in org config's `config_source`
2. **Ensure URL is accessible** (for private repos, configure auth)
3. **Verify org config** has matching `config_source` entry
4. **Test with:** `scc team validate --file path/to/team-config.json`

## Common Issues

### "Changes not taking effect"

1. Is your team actually team-managed? Check for `config_source` in org config
2. Is the `config_source` URL correct and accessible?
3. Has the cache expired? Run `scc update --force`
4. Are plugins formatted correctly (`plugin@marketplace`)?
5. Does the referenced marketplace exist?

### "Cannot add marketplaces"

Your org profile has `allow_additional_marketplaces: false`. Contact your org admin to request marketplace trust.

### "Plugin denied at runtime"

The plugin is probably not in the org's allowlist. Check:
1. `defaults.allowed_plugins` patterns
2. `delegation.teams.allow_additional_plugins` list
