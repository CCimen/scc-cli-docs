Delegation controls which teams can add resources and whether projects can extend team configurations.

## Organization to Team Delegation

Define which teams can add plugins and MCP servers:

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "teams": {
      "allow_additional_plugins": ["*"],
      "allow_additional_mcp_servers": ["platform", "data"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `["*"]` | All teams can add this resource type |
| `["team1", "team2"]` | Only listed teams can add |
| `[]` or missing | No team can add this resource type |

### Example: Restrictive Delegation

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "teams": {
      "allow_additional_plugins": ["platform"],
      "allow_additional_mcp_servers": []
    }
  }
}
```

Only the `platform` team can add plugins. No team can add MCP servers.

### Example: Permissive Delegation

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "teams": {
      "allow_additional_plugins": ["*"],
      "allow_additional_mcp_servers": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

All teams can add both plugins and MCP servers.

## Team to Project Delegation

Each team profile controls whether projects can add resources:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "backend": {
      "delegation": {
        "allow_project_overrides": true,
        "allow_additional_plugins": ["project-*", "team-*"]
      }
    },
    "security": {
      "delegation": {
        "allow_project_overrides": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### allow_project_overrides

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `true` | Projects can use `.scc.yaml` to add resources |
| `false` | Projects cannot add anything beyond team config |

### allow_additional_plugins (Team Level)

Patterns for what plugins projects can add:

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "allow_additional_plugins": ["project-*", "linter-*"]
  }
}
```

Projects can only add plugins matching these patterns.

## Delegation Chain

A project can only add a resource if:

1. The **organization** has delegated that resource type to the team
2. The **team** has `allow_project_overrides: true`
3. The resource matches the team's `allow_additional_plugins` patterns (if specified)
4. The resource doesn't match any security block

```
Organization delegates "plugins" to team "backend"
    ↓
Team "backend" has allow_project_overrides: true
    ↓
Team "backend" has allow_additional_plugins: ["project-*"]
    ↓
Project adds "project-linter" in .scc.yaml
    ↓
"project-linter" matches "project-*" pattern
    ↓
"project-linter" is not in blocked_plugins
    ↓
✓ Addition allowed
```

## Denied Additions

When a resource is denied, SCC tracks the reason:

```bash
scc config explain
```

Output:

```
denied_additions:
  - some-mcp-server  (requested_by: project, reason: team not delegated for MCP)
  - custom-plugin    (requested_by: project, reason: team disallows project overrides)
```

## Example: Complete Delegation Setup

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "teams": {
      "allow_additional_plugins": ["*"],
      "allow_additional_mcp_servers": ["platform", "data"]
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "backend": {
      "description": "Backend team - flexible",
      "delegation": {
        "allow_project_overrides": true,
        "allow_additional_plugins": ["*"]
      }
    },
    "frontend": {
      "description": "Frontend team - moderate",
      "delegation": {
        "allow_project_overrides": true,
        "allow_additional_plugins": ["react-*", "vue-*", "angular-*"]
      }
    },
    "security": {
      "description": "Security team - locked down",
      "delegation": {
        "allow_project_overrides": false
      }
    },
    "platform": {
      "description": "Platform team - can add MCP servers",
      "delegation": {
        "allow_project_overrides": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Start restrictive and grant delegation as needed. It's easier to expand than restrict.
</Aside>

## Bypassing Delegation

For urgent needs, developers can use local overrides:

```bash
scc unblock some-plugin --ttl 8h --reason "Testing integration"
```

This creates a time-limited exception. See [Exceptions](/guides/organization/exceptions/) for details.

<Aside type="note">
  Local overrides cannot bypass security blocks (the `blocked_*` patterns). They only work for delegation denials.
