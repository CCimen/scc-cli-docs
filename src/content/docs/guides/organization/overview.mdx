As an organization admin, you define the security boundaries and governance rules that all teams and developers must follow.

## Your Responsibilities

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Security Policies" icon="shield">
    Define what plugins, MCP servers, and images are blocked globally.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delegation" icon="setting">
    Control which teams can add plugins, MCP servers, or custom configurations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Marketplaces" icon="puzzle">
    Approve plugin marketplaces that teams can use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Profiles" icon="document">
    Create and manage team profiles (inline or federated).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## The Three-Layer Model

SCC enforces a hierarchical configuration system:

```
Organization (org-config.json)
    ↓ security blocks + defaults
Team Profile (profiles section)
    ↓ additional plugins/servers
Project (.scc.yaml in repo root)
    ↓ project-specific additions
```

Each layer can add to the previous, but **cannot remove security restrictions**.

<Aside type="note">
  Think of it as: You set the guardrails. Teams work within them. Projects customize further if teams allow it.

## What You Control (That Cannot Be Overridden)

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `security.blocked_plugins` | Plugin patterns nobody can use |
| `security.blocked_mcp_servers` | MCP server patterns nobody can use |
| `security.blocked_base_images` | Docker images nobody can use |
| `security.allow_stdio_mcp` | Whether stdio MCP servers are permitted |
| `defaults.allowed_plugins` | Governance whitelist for plugins |

## What Teams Control (Within Your Boundaries)

| Setting | Controlled By |
|---------|---------------|
| Additional plugins | Team leads (if delegated) |
| Additional MCP servers | Team leads (if delegated) |
| Session settings | Team leads |
| Project override policy | Team leads |

## Configuration Approaches

### Inline Profiles

Team configurations live directly in your org config file:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "backend": {
      "additional_plugins": ["java-tools@internal"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Best for:** Small organizations, centralized control.

### Federated Teams (GitOps)

Teams manage their own config repositories:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "platform": {
      "config_source": {
        "source": "github",
        "owner": "myorg",
        "repo": "platform-config"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Best for:** Large organizations, team autonomy.

## Quick Validation

Always validate your configuration:

```bash
scc org validate org-config.json
```

Check effective configuration:

```bash
scc config explain
```
