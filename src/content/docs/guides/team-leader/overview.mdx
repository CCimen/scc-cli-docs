As a team leader, you configure plugins, MCP servers, and settings for your team. This guide explains your responsibilities and options.

## What You Control

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Team Plugins" icon="puzzle">
    Select which plugins your team uses from the organization's allowed list.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Servers" icon="server">
    Configure MCP servers (context7, custom tools) for your team.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session Settings" icon="setting">
    Set default timeouts and auto-resume behavior.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project Overrides" icon="document">
    Control whether developers can add project-specific settings.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What You Cannot Control

These are set at the organization level and cannot be overridden:

| Setting | Controlled By |
|---------|---------------|
| Security blocks (plugins, servers, images) | Org Admin |
| Safety-net policy (block/warn/allow) | Org Admin |
| Allowed marketplaces | Org Admin |
| Network policy restrictions | Org Admin |

<Aside type="note">
  Think of it as: Org admins set the guardrails, you work within them to optimize for your team.
</Aside>

## Configuration Options

You have two ways to manage your team's configuration:

### Option A: Inline Configuration

Your team profile lives directly in the org config file. Changes require org admin to update the file.

**Best for:** Small teams, simple setups, teams that don't need frequent changes.

### Option B: GitOps (Federated Teams)

Your team maintains its own config repository. You can update plugins via PRs without involving org admin.

**Best for:** Autonomous teams, frequent updates, teams with specific tooling needs.

## Your Team Profile

A typical team profile includes:

```json
{
  "backend": {
    "description": "Backend development team",
    "additional_plugins": [
      "scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official",
      "java-tools@internal"
    ],
    "additional_mcp_servers": [
      {
        "name": "context7",
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://context7.example.com"
      }
    ],
    "delegation": {
      "allow_project_overrides": true,
      "allow_additional_plugins": ["team-*"]
    },
    "session": {
      "timeout_hours": 12
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Decisions

### Which plugins should we enable?

- Start with `scc-safety-net` for git protection
- Add language/framework specific tools your team needs
- Avoid enabling plugins "just in case" — keep it focused

### Should we allow project overrides?

- **Yes:** Gives flexibility, good for diverse projects
- **No:** Ensures consistency, good for security-sensitive teams

### What session timeout?

- **8 hours:** Security-focused, forces daily re-auth
- **12 hours:** Standard workday
- **24 hours:** Long-running tasks, data processing

## Validating Your Config

Always validate before deploying:

```bash
scc team validate
```

Or validate a specific config file:

```bash
scc org validate team-config.json
```
