Plugins extend Claude Code with additional capabilities. As a team leader, you select which plugins your team uses.

## Understanding Plugin Sources

Plugins come from **marketplaces**—repositories of approved plugins.

### Official Marketplace

The official marketplace is maintained by SCC:

```json
{
  "marketplaces": {
    "sandboxed-code-official": {
      "source": "github",
      "owner": "CCimen",
      "repo": "sandboxed-code-plugins"
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Marketplaces

Your organization may have internal marketplaces:

```json
{
  "marketplaces": {
    "internal-tools": {
      "source": "github",
      "owner": "your-org",
      "repo": "scc-plugins"
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding Plugins to Your Team

### Plugin Reference Format

```
plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Examples:
- `scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official`
- `java-analyzer@internal-tools`
- `react-devtools@frontend-marketplace`

### In Your Team Config

```json
{
  "additional_plugins": [
    "scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official",
    "java-analyzer@internal-tools",
    "spring-boot-helper@internal-tools"
  ]
}
```

## Essential Plugins

### scc-safety-net

The most important plugin. Blocks destructive git commands:

| Blocked Command | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| `git push --force` | Overwrites remote history |
| `git reset --hard` | Discards uncommitted changes |
| `git branch -D` | Force-deletes branches |
| `git clean -fd` | Deletes untracked files |
| `git checkout/restore` | Can overwrite local changes |

<Aside type="tip">
  Always enable `scc-safety-net` for all teams unless you have a specific reason not to.
</Aside>

Enable in your config:

```json
"additional_plugins": [
  "scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"
]
```

## Plugin Governance

### What Gets Blocked

Organization admins can block plugins by pattern:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "blocked_plugins": [
      "*experimental*",
      "*beta*",
      "untrusted-*"
    ]
  }
}
```

Even if you add these to your team config, they will be filtered out.

### What You Can Add

Your additions must:
1. Come from an approved marketplace
2. Not match any `blocked_plugins` pattern
3. Match `allowed_plugins` pattern (if org specifies one)

<Aside type="caution">
  If you try to add a blocked plugin, it will be silently filtered. Use `scc config explain` to see what's actually enabled.
</Aside>

## Allowing Developer Additions

You can let developers add project-specific plugins:

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "allow_additional_plugins": ["team-*", "project-*"]
  }
}
```

This lets developers add plugins matching those patterns in their `.scc.yaml`.

### Restrictive Approach

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "allow_additional_plugins": []
  }
}
```

Developers cannot add any plugins beyond team defaults.

### Permissive Approach

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "allow_additional_plugins": ["*"]
  }
}
```

Developers can add any non-blocked plugin from approved marketplaces.

## Auditing Plugins

See what plugins are currently installed:

```bash
scc audit plugins
```

Output:
```
Team: backend
Effective plugins:
  ✓ scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official (from: team)
  ✓ java-analyzer@internal (from: team)
  ✓ project-linter@internal (from: project/.scc.yaml)

Blocked plugins (attempted but filtered):
  ✗ experimental-tool@internal (matches: *experimental*)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not appearing

<Steps>
1. Check it's in an approved marketplace

   ```bash
   scc config explain --field marketplaces
   ```

2. Check it's not blocked

   ```bash
   scc config explain --field blocked_plugins
   ```

3. Check spelling of plugin and marketplace names

4. Force refresh config

   ```bash
   scc update --force
   ```
</Steps>

### Plugin blocked unexpectedly

The plugin matches a `blocked_plugins` pattern. Contact your org admin if you believe this is incorrect.

### Different plugins on different machines

Ensure everyone has the latest config:

```bash
scc update
```

Check effective config:

```bash
scc config explain --field plugins
```
