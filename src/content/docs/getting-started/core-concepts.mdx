Before diving deeper into SCC, it's helpful to understand the key concepts that make it work.

## Sessions

A **session** is a running Claude Code environment inside a Docker container. Each session:

- Is tied to a specific workspace (git repository)
- Uses a specific team profile
- Can be named for easy identification
- Can be resumed after stopping

```bash
# Start a new session
scc start ~/project

# Resume the most recent session
scc start --resume

# Pick from recent sessions interactively
scc start --select
```

### Session Lifecycle

## Sandboxes

A **sandbox** is the Docker container that isolates Claude Code from your host system. The sandbox:

- Has access only to mounted directories (your project)
- Cannot access sensitive files like `~/.ssh` or `~/.aws`
- Has network access controlled by your org's policy
- Uses a specific base Docker image

<Aside type="note">
  The term "sandbox" and "container" are often used interchangeably in SCC documentation. Technically, a sandbox is a container with specific security configurations.

## Team Profiles

A **team profile** defines the configuration for a group of users. Each profile includes:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `plugins` | Claude Code plugins enabled for this team |
| `mcp_servers` | MCP servers available to Claude |
| `network_policy` | Network access rules (unrestricted, corp-proxy, isolated) |
| `session` | Timeout and auto-resume settings |

Profiles are defined in your organization's config and can be:
- **Inline**: Defined directly in the org config file
- **Federated**: Defined in a separate team-managed repository

```bash
# List available teams/profiles
scc team

# Switch to a different team
scc team switch

# See current team
scc team current

# See team configuration
scc team info <team-name>
```

## Personal Profiles

A **personal profile** captures your own Claude Code preferences for a specific project. It sits between team config and workspace overrides so you can add your own plugins or MCP servers without changing org or repo settings.

```bash
# Save current workspace settings as a personal profile
scc profile save

# Apply personal profile on demand
scc profile apply
```

Learn more in [Personal Profiles](/guides/developer/personal-profiles/).

## Worktrees

A **worktree** is a git feature that lets you check out multiple branches simultaneously in different directories. SCC uses worktrees to:

- Isolate AI experiments from your main branch
- Allow parallel development on multiple features
- Keep your main branch clean

```bash
# Create a worktree for a new feature
scc worktree create ~/project feature-auth
# Creates: ~/project/.worktrees/feature-auth
# On branch: scc/feature-auth

# List all worktrees
scc worktree

# Enter a worktree (starts a subshell)
scc worktree enter feature-auth

# Switch between worktrees
scc worktree switch feature-auth
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Branch names with `/` are sanitized to `-` in worktree directory names. For example, `feature/auth` becomes `feature-auth`.
</Aside>

## Configuration Layers

SCC uses layered configuration with personal profiles:

Order of precedence:

**Organization → Team → Personal Profile → Workspace overrides**

## Plugins

**Plugins** extend Claude Code with additional capabilities. SCC manages plugins through:

- **Marketplaces**: Repositories of approved plugins
- **Allowlists**: Patterns defining which plugins are permitted
- **Blocklists**: Patterns defining which plugins are forbidden

The most important official plugin is **scc-safety-net**, which blocks destructive git commands.

## MCP Servers

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** provide Claude with access to external tools and data. Types include:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| HTTP | Remote API endpoints | context7, shadcn |
| SSE | Server-Sent Events streaming | Real-time data feeds |
| Stdio | Local subprocess servers | Playwright, custom tools |

<Aside type="caution">
  Stdio MCP servers require explicit organization approval via `allow_stdio_mcp: true` because they run local processes.
</Aside>

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Session** | A running Claude Code environment in a container |
| **Sandbox** | The Docker container providing isolation |
| **Profile** | Team configuration (plugins, servers, policies) |
| **Worktree** | Isolated git checkout for parallel development |
| **Marketplace** | Repository of approved plugins |
| **Safety Net** | Plugin that blocks destructive git commands |
