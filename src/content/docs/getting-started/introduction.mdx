**SCC (Sandboxed Claude CLI)** runs [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (Anthropic's AI coding CLI) inside Docker containers with organization-managed team profiles and git worktree support.

<Aside type="tip">
  SCC isolates AI execution in containers, enforces branch safety, and prevents destructive git commands. Organizations distribute plugins through a central config—developers get standardized setups without manual configuration.

## The Problem SCC Solves

When teams use AI coding assistants, several challenges emerge:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Security Risk" icon="warning">
    AI can execute arbitrary commands on your host machine, including destructive ones like `rm -rf` or `git push --force`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration Drift" icon="setting">
    Each developer sets up their environment differently, leading to inconsistent behavior and hard-to-reproduce issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plugin Chaos" icon="puzzle">
    Without governance, developers install random plugins that may conflict or introduce security vulnerabilities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Branch Pollution" icon="github">
    AI experiments can pollute your main branch with commits that break the build or introduce bugs.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How SCC Helps

### Docker Isolation

Every Claude Code session runs inside a Docker container. The AI can only access files you explicitly mount, and it cannot affect your host system directly.

### Centralized Configuration

Organization admins define a single JSON config that specifies:
- Which plugins are allowed/blocked
- Which MCP servers teams can use
- Security policies (network access, base images)
- Team-specific profiles

Developers just run `scc setup` once and they're ready.

### Git Worktree Integration

SCC uses git worktrees to create isolated branches for each task:

```bash
scc worktree create ~/project feature-auth
# Creates isolated branch scc/feature-auth
# Claude experiments here without touching main
```

### Safety Net Plugin

The official `scc-safety-net` plugin blocks dangerous git commands:

- `git push --force`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git branch -D` (force delete)
- `git clean -fd`
- `git checkout/restore` (potential data loss)

## Who Uses SCC?

| Role | What SCC Provides |
|------|-------------------|
| **Developers** | Instant setup, protected main branch, isolated experiments |
| **Team Leaders** | Approved plugin sets, consistent configs across the team |
| **Org Admins** | Security policies, blocked plugins, audit trails |

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Docker Desktop 4.50+** (requires sandbox support) — must be running with Docker Engine active
- **Git 2.30+**
- **uv** (recommended for installation)
