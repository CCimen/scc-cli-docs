      "repo": "sandboxed-code-plugins"
    }
  }
}
```

## Installing Plugins

Plugins are installed via organization or team configuration:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "enabled_plugins": [
      "scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Plugin Security

Plugins are atomic trust units:
- If allowed, all bundled MCP servers are also allowed
- Security blocks apply to plugin names, not internals
- Use `blocked_plugins` patterns to restrict
