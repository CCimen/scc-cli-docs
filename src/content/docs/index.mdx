## Why SCC?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Isolated Execution" icon="shield">
    Code runs in Docker sandboxes. Your host system stays protected from AI-generated commands.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standardized Configs" icon="setting">
    Organization-managed profiles distributed via a single URL. No manual setup for developers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Git Guardrails" icon="warning">
    Block destructive commands like `push --force` and `reset --hard` automatically with safety-net policies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parallel Development" icon="rocket">
    Isolated git worktrees per feature branch. Multiple Claude sessions without conflicts.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="note" title="v1 scope">
  v1 focuses on sandboxing, governance, and explainability. `network_policy` is
  partial enforcement, plugin-bundled MCPs are out of scope, and SCC is not a
  DLP or endpoint security product. See the [v1 scope](/release/v1-scope/) for
  details.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
1. **Install SCC CLI**

   <Tabs syncKey="pkg">
     <TabItem label="uv (recommended)">

     uv tool install scc-cli
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pipx">
     ```bash
     pipx install scc-cli
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pip">
     ```bash
     pip install scc-cli
     ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Verify your environment**

   ```bash
   scc doctor
   ```

3. **Configure and launch**

   ```bash
   scc setup    # Paste your org config URL
   scc start    # Launch in current directory
   ```
</Steps>
