description: What SCC v1 enforces and what remains advisory

  order: 1
---

SCC v1 focuses on a safe-by-default runtime wrapper, governed configuration, and clear explainability.
This page defines what SCC enforces at runtime, what is advisory, and what is out of scope in v1.

## Core identity

- Runs Claude Code inside Docker sandboxes with controlled mounts.
- Distributes org and team configuration consistently across users and projects.
- Enforces governance where SCC controls the surface.
- Explains what is active, blocked, or denied and why.

## Non-goals for v1

- No data loss prevention (DLP) guarantees.
- No inspection of plugin internals (plugins are the trust unit).
- No hard network egress firewall or proxy enforcement across all traffic.

## Enforcement states

- Enforced: SCC changes runtime behavior deterministically.
- Partially enforced: SCC enforces part of the intent and warns about the rest.
- Advisory: SCC validates and reports but does not enforce at runtime.
- Out of scope: SCC does not attempt to govern this surface.

## Scope by surface

| Surface | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plugins | Enforced | Managed via marketplaces and injected into runtime settings. |
| Marketplaces | Enforced | Materialized and injected into runtime settings. |
| MCP servers (org/team/project) | Enforced | Injected into runtime settings after policy gates. |
| MCP servers (.mcp.json) | Advisory | SCC does not modify repo files in v1. |
| MCP servers (plugin-bundled) | Out of scope | Block the plugin to block bundled MCPs. |
| network_policy | Partially enforced | Proxy env injection and MCP suppression; not a full egress firewall. |
| safety_net policy | Enforced when enabled | Enforced by the scc-safety-net plugin. |
| session.auto_resume | Advisory | Accepted in config but not enforced yet. |
